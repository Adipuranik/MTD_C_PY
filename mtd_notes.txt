history : multex, BPCL had bad memory, dennis richie added dynamic memory locaton
high cohesion and low cohesion(more terms less usage)

ARITHMATIC OPERATORS:

AO need 2 operators
operators bw operands is infix notation......prefix and post fix
input and op are numbers
datatypes of both the operands must be similar
left to right associativity w.r.t to reading the values/exp
for the calculatonto happen,the user/programmer give infix expression must be converted to postfix
reason: operators have diff precedence/hierarchy.

RELATIONAL OPERATORS: < > == != >= <=

LOGICAL OPERATORS : & && | || !

&& - short corcuited and
|| - short corcuited or

afternoon

5 STEPS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

1.  understand the problem recognize the input dataand the relevant info. isolate the unwanted data and info.recognize theop.
2. finfd the solution with all possible ways,trail and error method,applying an algorith stc.
3. write down the algorithm step by step procedure to solve the problem.each step must be atomic simple and finite
4. wite the fake code.(pseudocode)
code it.


to check if a number is perfect sqaure.

read ip number, say N
root = (integer) squareroot
root*root== N then 
     print N is perfect sqaure
	 else
	 print N is not perfect sqaure

fibonacc and prime of the given series

2nd smallest number of the given digit
to solve it in 1 loop

functions
restraunt example:
learnt abt function terminologies
address pointer
wild pointer
null pointer
stack overflow
prologue...main
function call stack
